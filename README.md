# **City Explorer App**

Welcome to City Explorer App. This mobile and web app is designed to help tourists explore UK cities through suggestions of local attractions. The app organises the attractions the user wants to visit into a personal bucket list based on preferences, and plans the most efficient route between them.

This app was developed in 2 weeks as our final project for the Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp. Our group is called Bug Busters, and is made up of Catherine Pulman, Michael Farah and Elizabeth Ray.

## Local Frontend Setup

To get the web app up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (minimum version: 21.7.3) installed.


### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal, ensuring you navigate to your desired directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michael-farah/city-explorer-app.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies using npm. Execute the following command in your terminal (ensure you're within the repository directory):

```bash
npm install
```

This command will fetch and install the required packages.

#### 3. Create Environment Variable Files

You'll need to create a .env file to store a Google Maps API key:

- Check the .env.example for an example of how this is written.

#### 4. Run On Your Local Browser

```bash
npm start
```
Click on the link displayed in your terminal.
    It should look something like this: http://localhost:8081
