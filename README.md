# **City Explorer App**

Welcome to City Explorer App. This mobile and web app is designed to help tourists explore UK cities through suggestions of local attractions. The app organises the attractions the user wants to visit into a personal bucket list based on preferences, and plans the most efficient route between them.

This app was developed in 2 weeks as our final project for Northcoders Software Development Bootcamp. Our group is Bug Busters, including Catherine Pulman, Michael Farah and Elizabeth Ray.
